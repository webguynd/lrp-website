### Turning food waste into electricity

Food waste is a big problem. Here in Washington, about 17% of what we seend to our landfills is food waste. Our food supply chain causes 40% of food waste in North America and we spend $218 billion per year to grow, ship and dispose of food that never even makes it to the dinner table.

So far, 10 of our nation's largest food retailers have recognized the problem and partnered with 20 of their suppliers to reduce their food waste in half by 2030. In our backyard, Washington passed E2SHB 1114 in 2019 which established a goal for the state to reduce food waste in half by 2030 as well.

### Anaerobic digestion can help our community hit food waste goals while providing power

Anaerobic digestion is the process of turning organic waste (like food waste) into biogas which is then used to generate electricity. As one of the top food producing states in the nation, we have six anaerobic digesters operating in Washington with a generating capacity of 4.05MW - about enough electricty to power over 400 homes. 

We've partnered with Vander Haak Dairy, home of Washington state's first anaerobic digester, to recycle organic materials in our community and keep waste out of our landfills and waster sources.

### What about the packaging?

There's another component to reducing waste in our food supply chain - packaging. Combined, food and packaging account for almost 45% of materials in our landfills. While composting, anaerobic digestion and charit programs can help reduce food waste, it can be labor intensive to separate food from its packaging, let alone sort the packaging for recycling. Because of this, many processors and markets might opt to just throw the waste in the garbage.

### Our depackaging machine

Here at Lautenbach Recycling, we've been help our community with sustainable waste management for 30 years. We know that for a recycling program to be effective, it needs to be easy. And since we like to make things easy for our customers, we've developed a way to efficiently separate food and organic waste from its packaging, allowing us to divert both waste sterams from our local landfills.

We're now able to help our customers join the 2030 food waste initiative without the overhead of depackaging and sorting.
