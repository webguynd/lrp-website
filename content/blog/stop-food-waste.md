### An astounding amount of food in America goes to waste

In the United States alone, 80 billions punds of food is thrown away every year. That's the equivalent of about 418 Seattle Spaceneedles!

            <h3>So exactly how much food do we waste?</h3>
            <p>
                America is the global leader in food waste. We discard about 40 million tons of food each year equating to approximately $161 billion.
                This comes out to 219 pounds of food waste per person, per year and accounts for roughly 40% of the entire United States food supply. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of this waste is sent to landfills, and is the single largest waste material taking up space in our landfills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fun Fact: Food waste makes up about 22% of municipal solid waste. That's a lot!

### Why do we waste this much food?

There are about 37 million Americans suffering from food insecurity leading many to wonder "Why do we waste so much food?" This is a challenge that explores a complex landscape of economic disparities, ingrained beliefs, confusion and human behavior and habits.

#### Real, or perceived food spoilage is one the biggest reasons we waste food

More than 80% of Americans throw out edible food simply because they misunderstand expiration labels. The industry uses many different terms such as "use by," "expries on," "best before," etc. leading to widespread confusion, so in an effort to avoid a foodborne illness, Americans will just throw the item in the garbage.

#### Americans are impulsive

We often unrealistically estimate how much food is required when we go shopping and buy more food than we need as a result, or buy food we won't actually eat. <br>
In addition, we underutilize left overs, and tend to throw out food scraps that can still be consumed or composted.

### Wasting this much food was environmental consequences

The food waste movement across America is gaining momentum, but it needs to pick up more speed to help tackle one of our plane'ts most pressing issues: climate change. Wasting food was lasting environmental effects. It waste the enegery and water it took to produce it. It also generates green house gasses in the landfill, 7% of the world's emissions - like methane, carbon dioxie and chlorofluorocabons, wich all contribute to global warming.

According to the World Wildflife Federation, America's food waste problem is equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions of 37 million cars. <br>
We believe this is unacceptable, and understand the environmental impact of continued waste could be catastrophic.

### There's economic consequences too

If helping no American go hungry and saving the planet aren't enough to inspire you to action, perhaps one more reason will: the economic impact.

According to the USDA, Americans waste more than $161 billion each year on food, with dairy products being the food item we waste the most. The average family of four will throw out about $1600 worth of produce a year. 

## How you can help at home

### 1. Don't misinterpert expiration labels

The Grocery Manufacturers Association, the Food Marketing Institute and Harvard University have partnered together to try and set a standard for food expiration labels. <br>
There are now two simple phrases to simply how you can tell what's still safe to eat.

> * "**Best if used by** is about food quality. When past this date, the product may not taste or peform as expected, but it is safe to consume 
> 
> * "**Use by** is reserved for those few products that are actually perishable and/or have a food safety concern over time.

### 2. Compost to keep food scraps out of landfills

Composting at home is easy. [Here's a get started guide](#). If you prefer, our partner [Skagit Soils](#) can help!

### 3. Freeze food that cannot be eaten immediately.

Freezing food is a great way to preserve food that you can't consume immediately. This allows it to be stored safely, often for a year or more, before consuming.

### 4. Share with others

Donate your left over food to local food banks, or give left overs to people in need.

### 5. Learn how to meal plan

Meal planning is a great, proven way to save both food and money. [We recommend this easy meal planning guide](#)

### 6. Don't be a perfectionist

Embrace fruits and vegetables with blemishes and flaws. They will still taste the same and are typically a fraction of the cost.
