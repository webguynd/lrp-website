### Energy efficient website

We are passionate about the evnironment and that cascades into everything we do, including this website! We believe the [website bloat crisis](#) is causing unecessary global emissions.
By using a [static site generator](#), we are able to serve this website very efficiently through a widely available [CDN](#).

### How do we measure the carbon footprint of our website?

TODO: Infographics about Kw/h each time the website is served. Explain the CDN and how caching works to reduce our energy footprint. 
By serving only static HTML/CSS/JavScript files, our website is efficient both on the server side and client side.
