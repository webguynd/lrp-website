## We're in this together

As a company we have a strict cleaning and disenfecting regimine for all of our office, payment methods, writing utnesils, trucks, common areas and more. We have rapidly implemented a robust remote work infrastructure and allow all those who are able to work from home to do so.
For those still on site, we are actively limiting direct interaction between staff and customers, as well as following all of the current best practices recommended by the CDC and industry experts.

It is all of our responsibility to work together to provide this essential service in the safest manner possibe.

Thank you, and be safe.
